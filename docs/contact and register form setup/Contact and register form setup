## Contact and register form setup

To set up the forms for the contact section and the register project section you'll use the Contact Form 7 plugin.

1. 	Install, if this hasn't been done yet, the Contact Form 7 plugin and activate it. 
2. 	Install, if this hasn't been done yet, the WordPress Importer plugin and activate it. 
3. 	Go to tools > import and import the XML file you see in the same folder as this document by 
	choosing 'wordpress' in the links that apear on that page. 
4. 	Go to the Contact form 7 plugin to check if both forms are imported
5. 	Create a new page called 'register'. Make sure its only the word in all lower case. 
	Copy the shortcode for the register form in here. You can find this in the Contact form 7 plugin. The ID's can change because of the import, but an example of this shortcode is: [contact-form-7 id="522" title="Register project"]
6. 	Repeat this for the contact form. Call this page 'contact' in all lower case. 
	Place here the shortcode of the form called 'contact form'.
